Development on City 2.

Any weird glitches?
mat_specular 0
or
mat_hdr_level 0
or
r_drawbatchdecals 0 

For the record, the ambient_generics in garrysmod will be broken (by playing at the origin) until the next update, which will /hopefully/ be pushed within a couple weeks. You might hear the waterfall at the origin, due to the fact that the entity which I used as a fix needs to be rendered either with LUA or by going to the waterfall and then going back out. On Novabox, it's fixed with LUA.

Thanks to everyone for helping me create this map over the course of several months-- it's turned out pretty good!

"City 2. God, I hate those two words. Ever since I've gotten here my throat has been hurting, none of the other new citizens have talked about it either. Maybe they're afraid the combine will hear 'em, and give them a beating. Me? I have this journal to talk to. I'm surprised I slipped it in my pants before they pushed us onto that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥razor train. It was cold, dark, and the horn creeps me the ♥♥♥♥ out. The whole ride was silent, except for the relentless scrape of the iron wheels on the iron tracks, and the occasional cough. Not even a whisper. When I first came off the train, I threw up. The air was frigid, and it was raining nonstop ash, like tainted snow, covering the world in a dusty clogging hell. If you squint it looks like snow, but that's about it. After getting off the train, we were hauled through a line. Everyone had to give a ticket, and if you didn't have it... Well... We never saw those people again. We also had to give these things called CID's, like cattle, or just another identical part, the one thing to make us stand out besides our faces. "Welcome to City 2." That was the first thing I heard in this city of the damned. Welcome my♥♥♥♥♥ That damn Consul up on his high horse, he's human, like the rest of us, but the combine gave him power after he forced the human race into submission before them. I guess he's a savior, but I would rather die with dignity, fighting, than deal with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I'm not going to suicide either, and if I was going to, I'd take as many of those ♥♥♥♥ers out as I could before. Anyways, once we were out, we were told to head to the apartments by some friendly looking UBC workers. Union Civil Benefactors. Civil Protection. The Consul. They're all the same to me. Traitors of their own race. Although some of the UBC Workers gave us funny looks, like they were up to something. It's easier to abuse power when you have it, I guess. They looked nourished, unlike the rest of us... Probably actually got fed. I heard they put amputated citizens in the rations, but hopefully it's just a rumour. Anyways, moving onto my original topic. We were given apartments, I got hooked up with this guy named Daniel..." 

This story takes place within City 2, a city located in an undisclosed location that resides in the past remnants of the United States of America. You are a Citizen, freshly scarred by the 7 Hour War, and being in concentration/holding camps for the past year has changed you physically, emotionally, and mentally. Every concept is new to you, Civil Protection, CID's, the Combine, how they work, their technology, and all that goes with the Universe of Half Life 2. Rebellion is unheard of, anyone caught of even suspicious activities is amputated publicly, without interrogation nor trial. Fairness is not needed with the Combine. Citizens are even beat for staring at an officer for too long. Any "uprisings" are crushed by the Civil Protection. This is the Combine's world, and you are only the cell in the organism. Easily replaced.

Remember that, and maybe you will survive.
